# My Solutions to the Problems of projecteuler.net

I began to do these problems when I started programming and have worked on them ever since. I think you can notice an upward trend in terms of quality of code and efficiency.

At times I sacrificed some solution efficiency so I could build a solution that showed/computed extra information or kept generality.

With no more to add, enjoy!
